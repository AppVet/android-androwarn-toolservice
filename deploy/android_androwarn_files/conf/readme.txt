To link the .xml file with a local .xsd, right-click on the .xsd file
and select Generate > XML File > Advanced > Link To File In System and
select the .xml file. To generate a linked file, Generate > XML File 
and generate template. You can change generated prefixes (e.g. "p:" to
"appvet:"), but do 
not remove prefixes from a .xml file as it will "unlink" it from the .xsd file.
