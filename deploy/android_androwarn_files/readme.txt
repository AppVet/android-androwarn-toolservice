For proper operation of Androwarn, the environment variable 
ANDROID_ANDROWARN_FILES_HOME should be globally set to the path for this 
directory. For example:


ANDROID_ANDROWARN_FILES_HOME = /home/<username>/android_androwarn_files


In addition, the environment variable ANDROWARN_HOME should be
globally set to the path of the Androwarn installation directory. For example:


ANDROWARN_HOME = /home/<username>/androwarn
